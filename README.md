Mappity
=======

Projector calibration for real 3D mapping in Unity

### Notes
- Though Mappity depends on EmguCV 2.4.10 (which depends itself on OpenCV 2.4.10), this project should be autonomous, all dependencies have been included in the project.
- EmguCV.Util.dll has been recompiled with a small change to ToolBox.cs to avoid EntryPointNotFound error, if you plan on updating EmguCV version, be sure to check that
- This project is compatible with both x86 and x64 versions
- Currently, Mappity has only been tested on Windows, but you can test it on OSX, just install EmguCV and OpenCV and copy the necessary files to /Plugins

Thank you
